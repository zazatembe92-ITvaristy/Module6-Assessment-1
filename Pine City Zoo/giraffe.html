            <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
            <p>The giraffe is an African artiodactyl mammal,the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant. It is traditionally considered to be one species,Giraffa camelopardalis with nine subspecies. However the existance of up to nine extant giraffe species has been described,based upon research into the mitochondrial and nuclear DNA as well as morphological measurements of Giraffa.Seven other prehistoric species, known from fossils,are extinct.</p>
            <p>The giraffe's chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs,its horn-like ossicones and its distinctive coat patterns.</p>
           
            <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
            <p>You will find giraffes in reserves such as Serengeti National Park and other grasslands and open woodlands in East Africa.</p>
