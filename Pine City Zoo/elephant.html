            <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
            <p>Elephants are the largest existing land animals.Three living species are currently recognised: the African bush elephant,the African forest elephant and the Asian elephant.</p>
            <p>African elephants have larger ears and concave backs,whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears,and convex or level backs.Distinctive features of all elephants includes a long proboscis called a trunk,tusks,large ear flaps,massive legs and tough but sensitive skin. The trunk is used for breathing,bringing food and water to the mouth and grasping objects. Tusks which are derived from the incisor teeth,serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. The large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature as well as in communication. The pillar-like legs carry their great weight. </p>
           
            <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
            <p>You will find elephants throughout sub-saharan Africa,South Asia and are also found in different habitats such as National Parks,Game reserves,forests,deserts and etc.</p>
